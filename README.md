## Google Homepage

My goal for this project is to recreate the Google Homepage.  It will test my HTML and CSS skills.  

I started this on May 14th and pushed the final commit on May 25th, working 30-60 minutes a night. I had to learn a lot about flexbox in order to do it.

I struggled with adding icons to the form input.  This is something I will need to come back to once I have spent more time on HTML.
